Although **Breakbeat** is a genre defined by its technical rhythm component (see more below), there is an underlying racial aspect at stake. Just like **Rock ‘n’ Roll** is a white translation of black **Rhythm ‘n’ Blues**, so is **Breakbeat** the “Caucasian” version of black **Rap** music. Though this division is not as strong as the **R&R** / **R&B** polarity (many black artists are involved in making **Breakbeat**), it is remarkable how the overwhelming majority of **Rap** artists are black, while the overwhelming majority of **Breakbeat** artists are white (considering the fact that these two super-genres are so closely related to each other). This has spurred the necessity of a true “black Dance music genre”, leading to **Jungle**. **Breakbeat** is arguably the most difficult super-genre to outline, being propelled by eager experimental artists with highly eclectic music taste.

Most **Breakbeat** is regarded as a part of **Hip Hop** culture, as (Just like **Rap**) it is also based on the sampling of **Funk** records to make breakbeats and mostly thrives in the same subculture with corresponding techniques (such as turntablism) or elements (such as graffiti or breakdancing).

The word “breakbeat” is derived from the section of early **Funk** or **Disco** records where all instruments stop playing (breaking) and only the drummer and percussion remains, called the “breakdown”. Such a breakdown section could be used by both **Rap** and **Breakbeat** artists to create their own drum samples without the use of a real drummer and before the advent of affordable drum computers. Some samples became more frequently used as breakbeat building blocks than others and received their own name and legendary status. The “Amen Break” for example, is a well-known sample from the Winston’s **Funk** single “Amen” from 1969. James Brown’s most outspoken breakdown in “Funky Drummer” became the basis for the “Funky Drummer Break”. Honey Drippers with “Impeach the President”, “Synthetic Substitution” by Melvin Bliss and “Apache” by the Incredible Bongo Band are all rather unknown Funk records, yet technically the most played records of all time due to a countless amount of resampling.

**Rap** and **Breakbeat** artists particularly like **Funk** and **Disco** breakdowns instead of **Rock** or **Blues** ones as these funky drummers introduced “the third beat”: placing kick drums on different beats than in a straight 4/4 rhythm. Both kick drums and snare drums fall on different beats in different bars, with hi-hat on offbeat, creating an asymmetrical pattern. **Breakbeat** differs from instrumental **Rap** in a slightly higher speed (110-120bpm) and a heavier use of samples, sound effects and sound manipulation, all placed in different layers at the right point to compose an intricate rhythmical web. This means that **Breakbeat** tracks are usually too rich and layered to allow rapping on top of them. Take note: harder, more Dance oriented versions of **Breakbeat** varying between 120-140 bpm exist as well and are easily distinguishable from Rap.

The middle ground between **Breakbeat** and **Drum ‘n’ Bass** has led to a whole group of music genres that can be considered a super-genre on its own: **UK Garage** (with the inclusion of **UK Bass**). **UK Garage** started as an experiment to renew **Drum ‘n’ Bass** with influences from other EDM such as **Breakbeat** and Garage House, but soon evolved into a broad and separate subculture with Dubstep as its most well-known exponent. UK Garage experiments with different, unexpected rhythms (like 2-step), creating highly syncopated breakbeat music with a variety of influences to provide treble and a strong **Drum ‘n’ Bass** influence to provide ultra-deep bass. The latest forms of **UK Bass** thrive in a strong underground internet culture. With artist names impossible to pronounce and sometimes even requiring special ALT or ASCII keys to type, the underground network of pirate radio’s which made **Drum ‘n’ Bass** great in the mid-nineties, seems to have been resurrected in a new form.

### [1982] Electro
True **Electro**, the beginning of **Breakbeat**, is essentially Hip-Hop music with lots of **Krautrock** influences (particularly Kraftwerk). American rappers embraced the German revolutionary music and quickly started making Rap music with the aid of drum machines and sequencers, resulting in digital sampling and looping of breakbeats (instead of mixing and scratching, although these two techniques were still heavily used for extra sound effects). **Electro** has few vocals let alone raps, though if they are present they are usually vocoded. Robotic breakdancing and vocoders give **Electro** that stereotypical futuristic “robo-feel”, often imitated or parodied.

The encounter between three (!) separate music worlds (Hip-Hop, Rock, and Electronic) finds its origin in two historical key events. In 1977, the infamous radio DJ “The Electrifying Mojo” starts playing a mix of **Funk** and **Synthpop** in Detroit: Proto-Electro that brings the black **Rap** community in touch with white electronic music.

On the other hand, the experiment of **Old Skool Rap** found itself in a precarious and fragile state at the beginning of the eighties. The music never really caught on and was in danger of being suppressed by **Synthpop**, which was growing exponentially in popularity. In New York, Afrika Bambataa, principal **Electro** artist and founder, tried to please both the (white) hipster **New Wave** scene as the (black) **Hip-hop** scene from the Bronx.

With lots of spacy, robotic sounds and basic synthesizer melodies this was definitely a completely different sound than your average **Rap** song or any early eighties genre for that matter. It must come as no surprise therefore, that **Electro’s** mission was accomplished and its influence on further electronic music beyond the scale.

Breakdancing is a fundamental element of Hip-Hop culture, as old as Hip-Hop itself. As a music genre however it doesn’t really exist. It’s a collection/mix of anything one can breakdance to: instrumental Rap, Electro, Deep Funk, chopped and mixed Soul records, turntablism… When the drum sampler was invented, music specifically made for breakdancing popped up. On one hand, there is a much heavier, faster, bass-driven type of Electro called Freestyle, with less subtle and catchier synthesizer melodies accompanied by powerful raps. Freestyle is also sometimes referred to as Electro Breakdance.

On the other hand, new heavy and melodic instrumental Funk records with lots of breaks and drum samples were being released for all the “b-boys” and “fly girls” to dance to. This Breakdance is quite different from Freestyle, but both are strongly tied together in the same subculture. The difference between Breakdance and Nu Funk or Deep Funk can be marginal, but Breakdance is true Breakbeat: it uses more pronounced breaks and more percussion while implementing Hip-Hop elements such as scratching, sampling (often Latin or orchestral in nature) and electronic sounds.

However, Freestyle also has a different meaning (but somewhat related) when it is used to describe Electro-influenced Disco, like Joyce Sims’ “Lifetime Love” for example. This type of Freestyle, heavily influenced by the TR-808 drum computer, is synonymous with “Electrodance” and a forefather to Eurodance.
